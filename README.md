LEDGoggles Arduino Sketches are a series of sketches for the Trinket-powered NeoPixel Goggles produced by AdaFruit (https://www.adafruit.com/products/2221)

These Sketches offer some improvements and fun tinkering around.


### Sketches
**Trinket_Blink**: Just like the standard blink code, which will blink the built-in LED. Try this first to make sure your Triinket is working

**LED_Goggles_BrightRamp**: this sketch will choose a random color and ramp it up and then back down. Both eyes are mirrored.

**LED_Goggles_Spin**: very simple red-and-blue spinny eyes

**LED_Goggles_Xmas**: an improvement on Goggles_Spin, with Christmas colors and nice trailing effects.

**LED_Goggles_Build**: slowly builds up LEDs

**LED_Goggles_Reverse_Spin**: reverse spin pattern, built by Endri Deliu
